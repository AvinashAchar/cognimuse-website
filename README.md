# CogniMuse Frontend Assignment

This project is a frontend implementation based on the provided Figma design. The focus was on layout structure, styling, and responsiveness.

---

## 🚀 Tech Stack Used

- React.js
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6)
- Google Fonts (Electrolize)

---

## 🤖 AI Tools Used

- ChatGPT
  - Used for help with layout structure, CSS fixes, responsive styling, and debugging UI issues.
  - Assisted in converting design ideas into code and improving code clarity.

---

## ⚡ Shortcuts / Assumptions

- Used the Figma design as the primary reference for layout, spacing, and typography.
- Static content and images were used instead of real backend or CMS data.
- Focused more on UI structure and responsiveness rather than advanced animations or logic.

---

## ⚠️ Known Issues / Incomplete Parts

- Minor text alignment issues in some sections.
- Some background images and visual effects from the design are simplified or not fully added.
- Advanced animations and transitions are not implemented.

## 📝 Notes

This assignment was completed with a focus on clean UI, readable code, and responsiveness within the given time. Further refinements can be added with more time.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
